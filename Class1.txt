Create policy for:

EC2 (All EC2 Read)--> Elastic compute cloud (VM OR INSTANCE)
Lambda (ALL)--> Serverless computing for developers
S3 (Secific bucket read) --> Simple storage service
VPC (Modify Rights) --> virtual private cloud 

ARN --> Amazon Resource Name

3 users --> IAM-User-dev --> Lambda
            IAM-User-CloudEng -->  EC2
            IAM-User-DEVOPS --> Admin

Add tags to search, organize and manage access.


Simple/Object Storage Service --> Upto 200 Buckets we can create (by default max limit) for each subscription
                                  and you can put unlimited objects into a single bucket
                                  object size limit --> 0KB - 5TB 


Bucket Level Policy 
Oobject Level Policy

S3 Storage Classes:

1.Standadrd Storage Class --> Stores frequently accessed data -->should have 1. low retrieval time (so that data should be imediately available)
                                                                            2. high cost
                                                                            3. high durability (99.999999999)
                                                                            4. High Avaibility (99.99)

2.Infrequent access Storage Class --> Stores infrequently accessed data --> RT high comparatively to ssc
                                                                            Less compared to SSC
                                                                            Durability and availability same as SSC

3.Glacier --> Backup and archive purpose --> high RT, COST LESS, DURABILITY AND AVAILABILITY - 99.99
exa : audit logs n all

4.Glacier Deep Drive --> archive data that is used very rarely --> very high RT , Very less, Durability and availability - 99.99

5. Intelligent- Tiering --> based on your access of data it will move accordingly to standard or infrequent class

create rule to move data from Stadard to IA after 2 months and delete it after 120 days.
