MASTER-SLAVE Architecture in Jenkins:

JENKINS MASTER - 
Scheduling build jobs.
Dispatching builds to the slaves for the execution.
Monitor the slaves.
Recording and presenting the build results.
Can also execute build jobs directly.

JENKINS SLAVE -
A slave is a Java executable that runs on a remote machine. The characteristics of the slave are :

It hears requests from the Jenkins Master instance.
Slaves can run on a variety of operating systems.
The job of a Slave is to do as they are told to, which involves executing build jobs dispatched by the Master.
We can configure a project to always run on a particular Slave machine or a particular type of Slave machine, or simply let Jenkins pick the next available Slave.

Labels: Labels are used to group multiple agents into one logical group. Multiple labels must be separated by a space.
with the help oflabel master will distribute jobs to slaves
